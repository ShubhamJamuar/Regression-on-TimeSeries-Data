# Regression-on-TimeSeries-Data
Using inbuilt scikit-learn models to predict the date of clearance of dues.
Random Forest Regressor has been used as the key model in this project. The target variable was shifted from clearance date to number of days after which the dues are cleared and subsequently it is used to find the clearance date.
